# Breaking Changes :fire:

## Migrate the database

- Expected duration?
- Possible data losses?
- Is it a simple migration? (fast/easy downgradable)

```sh
# run grunt migrate to update to the newest database scheme
# migration - 111-add-comments-table.js
#   create comments table + add events to the stream_events_types table
livingdocs-server migrate up
```




#### Dashboard Card Configuration :fire:

:fire: Removed project config `mediaLibrary.dashboard.displayFilters`. Move `mediaLibrary.dashboard.displayFilters` config to `mediaType.editor.dashboard.displayFilters` on the relevant mediaType configs.

:fire: Media Type Dashboard configuration

If you configure both `mediaType.editor.dashboard` (the dashboard opened in modals and through the document editing toolbar) and `mediaType.editor.managementDashboard` (the dashboard opened through the main navigation), the config used for the `managementDashboard` is compiled from the `dashboard` config and the `managementDashboard` config by overwriting on a top-level property level. Before, if `managementDashboard` was configured, the `dashboard` configuration was completely ignored.

Example:

```js
// behaviour before this change: management dashboard would not contain a displayFilter
// behaviour after this change: management dashboard contains the displayFilter configured in dashboard
mediaType.editor: {
  dashboard: {
    displayFilters: [{filterName: 'myFilter'}]
  },
  managementDashboard: {
    baseFilters: [{filterName: 'myBaseFilter'}]
  }
}
```

To get the old behavior, configure like this:

```js
mediaType.editor: {
  dashboard: {
    displayFilters: [{filterName: 'myFilter'}]
  },
  managementDashboard: {
    baseFilters: [{filterName: 'myBaseFilter'}],
    displayFilters: []
  }
}
```

#### Remove File Feature :fire:

- ðŸ”¥ Removed core feature `li-files`
- ðŸ”¥ Removed server API `liServer.features.api('li-files')`
- ðŸ”¥ Removed editing API `/files/upload`, use POST `/media-library/upload-file` instead

References: [Server PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-server/pull/3643)


#### Always activate copy component feature :fire:

ðŸ”¥ Remove editor config `copy.componentCopyEnabled`. The setting has no effect anymore, component copy is always enabled.

References: [Editor PR](https://github.com/livingdocsIO/livingdocs-editor/pull/4476)


#### Show insert component filter if there are more than 8 components :fire:

ðŸ”¥ Remove editor config `app.editor.insertPanel.useAdvancedComponentGroups`. The setting has no effect anymore. The filter on the insert panel is always shown if there are more than 8 components.
